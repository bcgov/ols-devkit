This tutorial demonstrates the interactive directions capability of the Location Services in Action application.

To understand a route, its often necessary to look at it from different zoom levels. The Location Services in Action app supports this by allowing you to control the map view from the Directions panel. Here's a demonstration.

1. Start up [Location Services in Action](https://bcgov.github.io/ols-devkit/ols-demo/index.html)
2. Select the Route tab
3. Add two random addresses within the current map view by selecting the Jump at Random icon (\*) next to each waypoint

4. Click on the first line of Directions. The line will be highlighted and the map will zoom to the starting intersection of the first route leg. The intersection will also be highlighted with a blue ring.

5. Click again on the first line of Directions. The highlight will disappear and the map will zoom back to the full extent of the route.

Every line in Directions behaves the same way.
