 * An intersector for the red-blue intersection problem.
 * In this class of line arrangement problem,
 * two disjoint sets of linestrings are intersected.
 * <p>
 * Implementing classes must provide a way
 * of supplying the base set of segment strings to
 * test against (e.g. in the constructor,
 * for straightforward thread-safety).
 * <p>
 * In order to allow optimizing processing,
 * the following condition is assumed to hold for each set:
 * <ul>
 * <li>the only intersection between any two linestrings occurs at their endpoints.
 * </ul>
 * Implementations can take advantage of this geometryFactory to optimize processing
 * (i.e by avoiding testing for intersections between linestrings
 * belonging to the same set).
